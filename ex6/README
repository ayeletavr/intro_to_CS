	1.2.1 valid_change: #DESCRIPTION#
	
	1.2.2 reverse_audio: get wav file and reverse it

	1.2.3 accelerate_speed: Gets audio wave and returns even samples of audio file.

	1.2.4 decelerate_speed: Gets audio wave and returns it with add samples between each 2
     	samples which is their average.

	1.2.5 raise_volume: get wav file and return ith with raised volume by 1.2

	1.2.6 lower_volume: get wav file and return ith with decreased volume by 1.2

	1.2.7 low_pass_filter: apply low pass filter on the input wav file

	1.3.1 unite_two_files: the new sampling rate is the smaller one, and the lists merging is done
    	according to the relative sampling rates as defined in the functions:
    	shorten_list_for_merge, merge_to_long_list

	1.3.1.1 find_greatest_common_divisor: find greatest common divisor,
	according to Euclid's algorithm

	1.3.1.2 shorten_list_for_merge: shorten the list according to the relative rates.
    	assisting unite_two_files

	1.3.1.3 merge_to_long_list: while two lists have value, the new value is the average,
        otherwise, the value of the long list

	1.4.1 text_file_ok:  check if name of text file is valid. boolean function.
