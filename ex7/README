I discussed the exercise with: Golan Shany

=============================
=  README for ex7: Recursion
=============================


==================
=  Description:  = implementation of recursive functions.
==================


======================
=  Special Comments  = Running times:
is_prime - O(sqrt(n)) - worst case is a prime number, which goes into i * i > n. 
print_no_repetition_sequence - O(n! / (len(char_list)-n)), if n == len(char_list): O(n!).
because worst case is to reach all letters, and then goes to next index.
flood_fill - O((n-1)^2) - worst case is when initial image is empty (all '.'). that it goes (n-1)^2 times.
======================

What's up Doc?
