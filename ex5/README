I discussed the exercise with: Golan Shany

=============================
=  README for ex5: Wordsearch
=============================


==================
=  Description:  = In this ex, we had to make a program that search certain words in a certain matrix.
the program can search in 8 different directions, and user choose directions to search.
==================


======================
=  Special Comments  = in check_wordsearch, i tested a function called search_r, that makes the "r" direction search.
test 01 - checks what happens when no words appears in matrix.
test 02 - checks what happens when a word is a whole row in matrix.
test 03 - checks what happens when word list contains a word more than one time.
test 04 - checks what happens when more that one word appears in matrix.

Side functions in find_words_in_matrix:
Side functions divides into two types:
1. functions that changes the input matrix (transpose, upside-down, revrse, diagonal) so search in "r" direction works in different directions.
2. function to every single direction out of 8. search_r function does the main search,
 and each direction "flippes" the input matrix in order to make an "r" direction in each direction.
======================

What's up Doc?
