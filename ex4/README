Answer to part C (theoretic):
I didn't use ascii letters, or the index-letter functions that were
to help.
So, I would only change conditions that contains bool to lower letters,
more specifically, lower_letter function that bools lower letters.

 For part C (tests) I chose these values:
harrypotter - see what happens when character appears more than once.
jk - short value.
siriusandseverus - long value.
horcrux - almost complete word.

What's up Doc?
